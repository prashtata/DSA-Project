# DSA-Project

This project was taken up as a part of the course Data Science Analysis at IITH. In this project,  We consider a dataset of housing having 17 features like area, existence of a garage, pool, attic etc. The price of the house is predicted using different machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, elastic net regression, support vector machine, random forest. To compare the efficiency and accuracy of each alogrithms different evaluation metrics like $R^{2}$ score, RMS error are calculated and compared across the different regression models.
